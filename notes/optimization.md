# Optimization Theory

**De Morgan's Law, Karnaugh Maps, the Quine-McCluskey method**

Now, if we were designing this machine without Verilog, the standard procedure would dictate that we draw a state machine. From there, we'd make a truth table with state transitions for each flip-flop. And after that we'd draw Karnaugh maps, and from K-maps we could get the optimized circuit.
